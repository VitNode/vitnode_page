# Rebuild

When you make some changes in themes, languages and plugins like adding, updating or removing, you need to rebuild the project to apply the changes.

VitNode uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) which require a rebuild to make optymalizations and apply changes.

## Rebuild the project

```bash
pnpm docker:prod
```
