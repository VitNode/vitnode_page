# Overview Setup

We're glad you're here! In this guide, step by step, we'll show you how to set up your production environment for the first time.

As an example, we'll use a server with `Debian` OS. Before you start, make sure you have everything from the [Requirements](/requirements) page.

## Testing

You don't need install VitNode on your server now. You can test in before you choose to install it. More info on the [Testing](/setup/testing) page.
