# Icons

VitNode uses [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and Emoji as icons. We're created a few components to help you use them.

But, before we start...

## Use JSX

To use Lucide Icons, we're really recommend you to use JSX _(Insted of using `Dynamic Icon`)_. It's the best way to use them.

```tsx
import { Home, KeyRound } from "lucide-react";

return (
  <div>
    <Home />
    <KeyRound />
  </div>
);
```

### Dynamic Icon

You can use dynamic icons with JSX too. Use this component if you want to download the icons as "text" from database or something like that.

```tsx
import { Icon, type IconLucideNames } from "@/components/icon/icon";

return <Icon name="Home" />;
```

## Icon Input

This component is a simple icon picker. You can use it to select a icon from Lucide Icons and Emoji.

```tsx {8, 18}
import {
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage
} from "@/components/ui/form";
import { IconInput } from "@/components/icon/input/icon-input";

return (
  <FormField
    control={form.control}
    name="icon"
    render={({ field }) => (
      <FormItem>
        <FormLabel>Icon</FormLabel>
        <FormControl>
          <IconInput {...field} />
        </FormControl>
        <FormMessage />
      </FormItem>
    )}
  />
);
```
