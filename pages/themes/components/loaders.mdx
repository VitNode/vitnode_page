# Loaders

VitNode provides a few loaders to help you load any data to the frontend.

## Loader

This loader looks like a spinner and it's used to show that something is loading.

```tsx
import { Loader } from "@/components/loader";

export const TestComponent = () => {
  if (isLoading) return <Loader />;

  return <div>Test</div>;
};
```

This component accepts also a smaller version by passing the `small` prop.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can use `<Loader />` component to show a loader in the middle of the page
  when you're loading data.
</Callout>

## Build-in Loaders

We're modifying few components to help you load data to the frontend. You can use the `loading` prop to show a loader inside the component.

### Button

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export const TestComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Button type="submit" loading={isPending}>
      {t("save")}
    </Button>
  );
};
```

### DropdownMenuItem

```tsx
import { DropdownMenuItem } from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu";

export const TestComponent = () => {
  return (
    <DropdownMenuItem loading={isPending}>{t("testing")}</DropdownMenuItem>
  );
};
```
